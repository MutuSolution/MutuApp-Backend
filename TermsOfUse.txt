MutuApp Terms of Use
Last Updated: March 18, 2025
Introduction
Welcome to MutuApp, an online platform where users can share, store, and discover web links. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the MutuApp website and services ("Service"). By registering for an account or using MutuApp in any way, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use MutuApp. MutuApp operates globally and welcomes users from around the world. Please note that the platform's interface and content are provided in English only. By using MutuApp, you acknowledge that you can communicate in English and understand these Terms. You are responsible for ensuring you comprehend all information in these Terms and on the platform, as translations are not provided.
Account Registration & Eligibility
You must register for a MutuApp account to share and save links on the platform. Registration is free of charge. To create an account, you will be asked to provide a unique username, your first and last name, a valid email address, and a secure password. You agree to provide accurate and complete information during registration and to keep this information up to date. By registering, you represent that you are at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required by laws in your country to use an online service) and are capable of entering into a binding agreement. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian to use MutuApp. Accounts are intended for personal use; you should not transfer your account to others or create multiple accounts for the same individual. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
Using MutuApp (Sharing and Discovering Links)
MutuApp allows you to post web links (URLs) along with titles and descriptions, and to organize or save them for future reference. When sharing a link, you can choose to mark it as Public or Private:
Public Links: Public links are visible to all users on MutuApp. Public links may appear on the MutuApp homepage, in search results, or in feeds, allowing the community to discover and access them.
Private Links: Private links are only accessible to you (the account owner). Other users will not see your private links on the homepage or anywhere else on the platform. Private links let you bookmark or save content for your personal use.
Even when content is marked as Private, it must still comply with these Terms and MutuApp’s policies. All links and descriptions you share should be appropriate and lawful. You retain ownership of the content you post, but you give MutuApp permission to store and display it on the platform (as needed for Public links). You can remove your content at any time, and setting a link to private or deleting it will remove it from public view.
Content Moderation & Prohibited Content
MutuApp is committed to maintaining a respectful and safe environment for all users. By using the platform, you agree to engage in civil and lawful behavior. You must not post, share, or store any content on MutuApp that:
Spam or Scams: Involves unsolicited advertising, bulk messaging, pyramid schemes, phishing attempts, or any form of deceptive or fraudulent schemes. Do not use MutuApp to spam users or promote questionable products and services.
Hate Speech or Harassment: Promotes or incites hatred, discrimination, or violence against individuals or groups based on factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics. Additionally, any form of harassment, bullying, or targeted abuse towards an individual is prohibited.
Violence or Graphic Content: Depicts extreme or graphic violence, gore, or content that is primarily intended to be shocking or disturbing. Threats of violence or any content encouraging harm or self-harm are strictly forbidden.
Explicit or Pornographic Material: Contains pornography or sexually explicit material. MutuApp is not an adult content platform; any content not suitable for a general audience (including children) is not allowed. Keep content appropriate for all age groups.
Illegal Activities: Advocates or depicts illegal activities or the use of illegal substances. This includes instructions for wrongdoing (e.g., how to commit a crime), content that facilitates the sale or use of illicit drugs or weapons, or any depiction of animal cruelty or other unlawful acts.
Copyright Violations: Involves sharing copyrighted material (text, images, videos, software, etc.) that you do not have the right to distribute. Only post content (including linked media or descriptions) that you have created or have permission to share. Links to pirated downloads or unauthorized copies of protected content are not allowed.
Personal Private Information: Reveals personal information about someone else without their consent. This includes personal addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, financial information, or other confidential details (often referred to as doxing). Respect everyone's privacy.
Misinformation or Fraud: Spreads false or misleading information that could cause harm. This includes deliberate misinformation, fake news, or fraudulent claims. Ensure that your descriptions and comments accurately reflect the content of your links and do not deceive other users.
Security Threats: Contains viruses, malware, or any malicious code, or links to sites that might compromise another user's security. Also, you must not attempt to hack, attack, or disrupt the MutuApp service or other users' accounts. Any content that could pose a cybersecurity risk is forbidden.
Other Inappropriate Content: Includes anything that is otherwise inappropriate or objectionable in a community setting, or that violates any applicable law or regulation. Use common sense and respect community standards when sharing content.
MutuApp reserves the right to review, filter, and remove any content that violates these guidelines or that we, at our sole discretion, deem inappropriate for the platform. We encourage users to report content they believe violates these Terms using our reporting tools. Reports will be reviewed within five (5) business days. Our moderation team will evaluate the reported content and determine an appropriate course of action, which may include content removal, warnings, or account suspension/termination for the user who posted it. Keep in mind that violating these content rules can have consequences. Users who repeatedly or egregiously violate the rules may have their content removed and could be temporarily suspended or permanently banned from MutuApp. We also comply with legal obligations: if we're notified of illegal content, or if content is subject to a court order or law enforcement request, we will act accordingly (which can include removing or restricting access to such content).
Account Management (Profile, Suspension, and Deletion)
As a MutuApp user, you have a personal profile associated with your account. You are encouraged to keep your profile information accurate and up to date. You may update your name, email, and other details through your account settings. Remember that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for any activity that occurs under your account. Account Deletion: If you wish to delete your MutuApp account, you can request this at any time. To initiate account deletion, send an email to MutuApp’s support team (at support@mutuapp.com) from the email address associated with your account. In your email, clearly state (or use the subject line) "I want to delete my account." For security reasons, we can only process deletion requests that come from the email address tied to the account. Once we receive a valid deletion request, we will process the account removal. This means your personal data and content will be removed or anonymized in our systems (some minimal data may be retained as required for legal compliance or legitimate business purposes, such as in server backups, for a limited time). MutuApp also reserves the right to manage the platform for the benefit of the community and service integrity. We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms, create risk or possible legal exposure for us, or engage in fraudulent, abusive, or disruptive behavior. Additionally, accounts that are inactive for a very long period may be suspended to free up resources (we will notify you beforehand in such cases). If we suspend or terminate your account, we will make a reasonable effort to inform you at the email address on file and explain the reason for this action, unless we are legally prevented from doing so.
Security & Privacy
We prioritize the security of our platform and the privacy of our users. However, maintaining security is a shared responsibility between MutuApp and you, the user:
Account Security: You must protect your account by keeping your username and password confidential. Choose a strong, unique password and do not share it with anyone. If you suspect that your account has been compromised (for example, if you notice unauthorized activity or you lose access to your email account associated with MutuApp), notify us immediately and change your password. You are responsible for all actions taken using your account credentials.
User Responsibility: You are responsible for any content or actions that originate from your account. Log out of MutuApp when using a shared or public device to prevent unauthorized access. MutuApp will consider any activity conducted through your account as having been done by you, the account holder.
Platform Security Measures: MutuApp implements technical and organizational measures to safeguard our systems against security threats and unauthorized access. While we strive to protect the platform and your data, no online service can guarantee 100% security. By using MutuApp, you acknowledge that there are inherent risks (such as the potential for data breaches) and agree that MutuApp is not liable for breaches beyond our control. We will promptly notify affected users and authorities of any significant data breach in accordance with applicable laws.
Privacy of Personal Information: The personal information you provide to MutuApp during registration and use (such as your name and email address) is collected and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We do not sell or disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as necessary to provide the MutuApp service or as required by law. We store your data securely and use it only for purposes outlined in the Privacy Policy (for example, to communicate service updates or respond to support requests). By using MutuApp, you also consent to receiving administrative communications from us (such as account notifications or policy updates) via the email address you provided.
Intellectual Property Rights
MutuApp respects intellectual property rights and expects users to do the same. The platform’s original content, features, and functionality are the exclusive property of MutuApp (or its parent company) and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. This includes the MutuApp name, logo, branding, and all software and design elements of the site. You may not use MutuApp’s name, logos, or other trademarks without our prior written consent, except as allowed by law. When you share content on MutuApp (such as the titles and descriptions you add to links), you retain ownership of your original content. Posting content on the platform does not transfer ownership to MutuApp. However, by submitting or posting content, you grant MutuApp a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, display, distribute, and create derivative works of your content in connection with operating and promoting the Service. This license is necessary so that we can display your content to you and other users (for example, showing your public links on the homepage or in search results). This license ends when you remove your content from the platform or delete your account, but note that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period (though it will not be visible to others). You are responsible for ensuring that you have the rights to any content that you post or share via MutuApp. Do not post material that infringes someone else’s copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights. If you link to external content, ensure that the content is lawful and that the act of linking does not violate any terms of the external site. If MutuApp receives a proper notification of alleged copyright infringement (for instance, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act "DMCA"), we will respond by investigating and, if appropriate, removing the infringing content. We may suspend or terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in accordance with applicable laws and our policies.
Liability & Disclaimer
User-Generated Content
MutuApp is a platform that hosts content created and shared by users. We do not pre-approve, monitor, or endorse the links and descriptions that users post. This means that MutuApp is not responsible or liable for the accuracy, legality, or appropriateness of any user-generated content on the platform. If you access or click on links shared by other users, you do so at your own discretion and risk. MutuApp will not be held liable for any consequences or damages arising from your use of or reliance on content posted by other users. However, if content that violates our policies is reported or otherwise brought to our attention, MutuApp will review it and take appropriate action (such as removing the content or suspending the responsible account), as described in the Content Moderation section above. We are committed to enforcing these rules to maintain a safe and welcoming community on MutuApp.
Disclaimer of Warranties
Your use of MutuApp is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, MutuApp disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of harmful components (such as viruses). We make no warranty that the links or content provided by users will be reliable or accurate. While we strive to correct any issues and keep the platform safe, we cannot guarantee complete satisfaction or perfection in the service.
Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, MutuApp and its affiliates, officers, employees, and partners shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting from or in connection with your use of the Service or these Terms. This includes, without limitation, any loss of profits, loss of data, cyberattack-related damages, or other intangible losses, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. You specifically acknowledge that MutuApp is not liable for the conduct of third parties (including other users) or for external websites and content that may be accessed via links on our platform. In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the unlikely event that MutuApp is found liable for any claim or dispute arising from your use of the Service, our aggregate liability to you (for any and all claims combined) will not exceed the greater of the amount (if any) you paid us to use the Service or one hundred US dollars (USD $100).
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless MutuApp, its parent company, affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) that arise from: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your violation of these Terms; or (c) your violation of any rights of a third party (for example, posting copyrighted material without permission or violating someone’s privacy). This indemnification obligation will survive the termination of your account or these Terms.
Termination of Service
You are free to stop using MutuApp at any time. If you decide to permanently leave the platform, you have the option to delete your account as described in the Account Management section above. MutuApp reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service (including deleting your account) at our discretion, with or without prior notice. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, your violation of these Terms, extended periods of account inactivity, your request (account deletion), unexpected technical or security issues, or if we discontinue the service. We will attempt to notify you via your registered email address if your account is being suspended or terminated, unless legal reasons prevent us from notifying you. Upon termination of your account for any reason, your right to use MutuApp will immediately end. Any content you have stored may be deleted as part of the termination process (aside from data we may need to retain for legal or backup purposes). MutuApp shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination of your account or access to the Service, or for the removal of your content.
Changes to These Terms
We may update or modify these Terms of Use from time to time. As our platform grows and laws evolve, changes might become necessary. If we make material changes to the Terms, we will notify users by posting the updated Terms on the MutuApp website and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. In some cases, we might also send a notice via email or through a prominent notification within the Service. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically for updates. When we update the Terms, the changes are effective immediately upon posting, unless stated otherwise. By continuing to use MutuApp after a new version of the Terms has been posted, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree with any changes to the Terms, you should stop using the Service and, if you have an account, delete it.
